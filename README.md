# Steam Review Template

This is a tool to simplify the creation of copy-pasta reviews that are somewhat popular on Steam. The categories and options are not from my head, I just copied them from somewhere. There are some minor variations on some of the options, but this is the typical rundown.

## Usage

You just tick all the boxes that you want, the output should look something like this:

```
---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☐ Decent
☐ Fast
☑ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer
```

It will generate with a line on the bottom that gives me credit. I would appreciate it if you left it there, but you don't have to if you don't like it :)
